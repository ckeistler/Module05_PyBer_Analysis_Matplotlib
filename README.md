# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5's focus was on introducing Matplotlib and Numpy alongside continued use and implementation alongside Pandas.  We were provided ride-sharing data in the form of two CSV files, city_data, which included data on city, driver count per city, and type of city (Urban, Suburban, Rural).  The second file, ride_data, included per ride information by city with date, fare, and ride_id fields.  Once merged, we constructed DataFrames using the groupby().count() and grouby().sum() functions, and we plotted line, bar, scatter, and box plots.

## Overview
The back story to Module 5's Challenge was the following, "V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer."
  - Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  - Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
  - Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)
